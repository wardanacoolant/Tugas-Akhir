# My Thesis Project

This is a repository related to the bachelor thesis of mine (and my spesialization group, Knowledge Discovery and Management).

## Background

As an undergraduate student, it has become an obligation to arrange the final project. For the sake of safety files from things that are not desirable, this repository was made.

## Aim

IIt is very clear, namely achieving the title of S. Kom to us.

## Benefits

Helped realize Mr. Suhar's vision, which wanted to "graduate the 2016 generation on time".
